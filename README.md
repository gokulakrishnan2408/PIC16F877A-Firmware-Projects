# PIC16F877A-Firmware-Projects
This repository contains embedded firmware projects developed using the PIC16F877A microcontroller. All programs are written in Embedded C and tested via simulation using Proteus. These projects demonstrate fundamental embedded software skills including peripheral control, display interfacing, and signal generation
